This file will handle the game logic.\n\nmodel.js\n```javascript\nclass Game {\n    constructor() {\n        this.gridSize = 20;\n        this.snake = [{ top: 10, left: 10 }];\n        this.direction = 'RIGHT';\n        this.food = null;\n    }\n\n    // Method to update the snake's position based on the current direction\n    updateSnake() {\n        const head = Object.assign({}, this.snake[0]); // copy head\n\n        switch (this.direction) {\n            case 'LEFT':\n                head.left--;\n                break;\n            case 'UP':\n                head.top--;\n                break;\n            case 'RIGHT':\n                head.left++;\n                break;\n            case 'DOWN':\n                head.top++;\n                break;\n        }\n\n        this.snake.unshift(head); // add new head to snake\n    }\n\n    // Method to check if the snake has eaten the food\n    checkFood() {\n        if (this.food && this.snake[0].top === this.food.top && this.snake[0].left === this.food.left) {\n            this.food = null; // remove food\n        } else {\n            this.snake.pop(); // remove tail\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Method to check if the game is over\n    isGameOver() {\n        const head = this.snake[0];\n        return head.top < 0 || head.left < 0 || head.top >= this.gridSize || head.left >= this.gridSize || this.snake.some((_, i) => i !== 0 && _.top === head.top && _.left === head.left);\n    }\n\n    // Method to change the direction of the snake\n    changeDirection(newDirection) {\n        const directions = {\n            'UP': 'DOWN',\n            'RIGHT': 'LEFT',\n            'DOWN': 'UP',\n            'LEFT': 'RIGHT'\n        };\n\n        if (directions[newDirection] !== this.direction) {\n            this.direction = newDirection;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext, let's create the `view.js` file. This file will handle the rendering of the game state.\n\nview.js\n```javascript\nclass View {\n    constructor(game, gameBoard) {\n        this.game = game;\n        this.gameBoard = gameBoard;\n        this.context = this.gameBoard.getContext('2d');\n        this.cellSize = this.gameBoard.width / this.game.gridSize;\n    }\n\n    // Method to draw the game state\n    draw() {\n        this.context.clearRect(0, 0, this.gameBoard.width, this.gameBoard.height); // clear canvas\n\n        // draw snake\n        this.game.snake.forEach(part => {\n            this.context.fillStyle = 'green';\n            this.context.fillRect(part.left * this.cellSize, part.top * this.cellSize, this.cellSize, this.cellSize);\n        });\n\n        // draw food\n        if (this.game.food) {\n            this.context.fillStyle = 'red';\n            this.context.fillRect(this.game.food.left * this.cellSize, this.game.food.top * this.cellSize, this.cellSize, this.cellSize);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, let's create the `controller.js` file. This file will handle user inputs.\n\ncontroller.js\n```javascript\nwindow.onload = function() {\n    const game = new Game();\n    const view = new View(game, document.getElementById('game-board'));\n\n    // Function to update the game state and redraw the game board\n    function update() {\n        game.updateSnake();\n        game.checkFood();\n        view.draw();\n\n        if (game.isGameOver()) {\n            clearInterval(intervalId);\n        }\n    }\n\n    const intervalId = setInterval(update, 100);\n\n    // Event listener for arrow keys\n    window.onkeydown = function(event) {\n        const directions = {\n            'ArrowUp': 'UP',\n            'ArrowRight': 'RIGHT',\n            'ArrowDown': 'DOWN',\n            'ArrowLeft': 'LEFT'\n        };\n\n        if (directions[event.key]) {\n            game.changeDirection(directions[event.key]);\n        }\n    };\n};\n```\n\nThis completes the implementation of the snake game in JavaScript using the MVC pattern. The game logic is handled by the `Game` class in `model.js`, the game state is rendered by the `View` class in `view.js`, and user inputs are handled by the `controller.js` file. The game starts when the page is loaded and ends when the snake hits the border or itself. The snake's direction can be controlled using the arrow keys."}]
