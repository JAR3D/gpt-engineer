The player maneuvers a growing snake, initially one unit long, to eat randomly placed food on screen, each food intake extending the snake by a unit. The game concludes if the snake hits itself or the grid's border. In the game's Model-View-Controller structure, the Model handles game logic: snake's position, food location, consumption status, and game end. The View renders the game visually, depicting the grid, snake, and food. The Controller processes user inputs, specifically arrow keys directing the snake's movement. The keydown event listens for arrow key presses, with event.key or event.code discerning the specific key pressed. A function should be developed to change the snake's direction based on the key pressed, ensuring it doesn't reverse into itself instantly\n\nIs anything else unclear?
